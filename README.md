# JZFlow

#### ðŸš§ Current Status: Incubating - JZFlow is not ready for production usage. The API is still evolving and documentation is lacking.

JZFlow is a Pipeline for the Rust programming language that prioritizes ease-of-use. It supports both Single Machine as well as some distributed environments, including Kubernetes and Cycle.IO. Note that JZFlow does not hide the Pipeline; instead, JZFlow exposes features based on the target pipeline.

### Current Status and Roadmap

JZFlow is still in the early development stages and is considered **incubating**. There is no commitment to ongoing maintenance or development. As the project evolves, this may change in the future. Therefore, we encourage you to explore, experiment, and contribute to JZFlow, but do not attempt to use it in production.

The immediate next steps for the project are to fill obvious gaps, such as implementing error handling, removing panics throughout the codebase, supporting additional data types, and writing documentation. After that, development will be based on feedback and contributions.
